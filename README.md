jacobwalker/dotfiles
====================

My dotfiles for common utilities. Probably not very interesting, but I find it useful to have them in git.

I try to add plugins as submodules, but where this isn't possible, I'll credit them as comments :)

Dependencies that aren't resolved by submodules:
- rbenv (https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv)
- thefuck (https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck)
